If you own the original tracks, place them in the `Assets/Data` folder.
The repository includes the required `.meta` files, so if the assets are added correctly, everything should be ready for a successful build.

- Developed with **Unity `v6000.1.4`**, but should also work with other versions of Unity.
- Requires the **Android Build Support** module for Unity.
